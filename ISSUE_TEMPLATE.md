Hey there

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com). 


None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** example that reproduces the bug.
- [ ] Provide **screenshots** where appropriate
- [ ] Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
